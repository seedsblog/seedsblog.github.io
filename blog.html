<h2>Hosing down the snake plant family – review of Hozelock Pico Reel</h2>
	
<center><img src="pics/gitl.jpg" style="width:200px;height:230px;"></center>
	
	<p>I get excited each spring because when the weather is finally warm enough, I like to give my prized snake plants a good outdoor showering.  This year, I had the privilege of working with Lee Valley to review their Hozelock Pico Reel - a compact sprayer, perfect for small spaces. Disclaimer: this was a paid partnership with Lee Valley to review the Hozelock Pico Reel product.I hope you've enjoyed this blog post on showering my snake plants with the Hozelock Pico Reel available at Lee Valley. I have been a loyal customer for many years so I'm happy that I can work with them in this capacity!After an hour or so, I load the kids into their tubs and bring them back to their containers. I always try to plant into nursery pots (have drainage holes) and place those into cachepots (containers without drainage holes). With this potting strategy, it's easy to ensure even soil moisture while keeping interior shelves/surfaces clean and dry.If one is good, three is better and five is, well...merrier. Different types of plants look best when arranged in groups of three or five -- or more. You'll be amazed at how the different leaf textures and colors can complement each other. Showcase a one in bloom by putting it front and center.</p>

<h2>How To Create A Plant Loving Home</h2>

	<p>VARIETY IS KEY!</p>
	<p>The essential concept behind any urban jungle is to mimic nature in its extraordinary diversity of species, sizes, forms and colors. When designing a personal urban jungle at home, variety is key, like in nature. The combination of different sizes of plants is the first step to creating your indoor jungle. For instance, purchase a giant one that goes on the floor and mix it up with some smaller ones. Try some plant stands and rope hangers to display your plants at different levels.If you just go for the same textures, like all small leaves or big leaves or prickly, your garden will look boring..</p>
	<p>Often play around with your pots. Prepare some terracotta, copper, etc. then, mix them up. Add candles and personal object close to your heart.If you have some old plant pots or teacups, they will be good materials to customize them with paint. Or, you can find some online or other vintage shops.f you're like me, you've covered every table top, shelf, and counter with plants.That's why I love multi-tiered indoor plant stands...they offer an easy solution for styling them. By grouping a variety of plants at varying heights, you can turn a haphazard jungle into an orderly arrangement. Quickly. Easily. No decorating talents needed.mall plants are quite beautiful on their own. Unfortunately, they tend to get crowded together on a table, where none of them are presented to their advantage.So, how do you make a small plant stand out? Make one shine by placing it on a pedestal plant stand by itself. Slip the plant in a decorative cachepot to dress it up.By rotating plants, you can make a star out of one that's looking its best. Put a moth orchid on the pedestal when it's in bloom. When it's not, give your flowering African violet its turn in the spotlight.</p>

<h2>What Soil Do I Use For My Houseplant? You Can Grow That!</h2>
	<center><img src="pics/soil.jpg" style="width:300px;height:200px;"></center>
	
  <p>Soils that aren’t organic may contain chemical fertilizers that your houseplants can come to rely on for growth. As I mention when I speak about growing a healthy indoor garden, you are Mother or Father Nature for your houseplants.That being said—you want to act like a responsible plant parent and teach your plants to become self-sustaining. That’s impossible if you’re feeding their soil with chemical fertilizers—as the chemical fertilizers need to be replaced quite frequently or the plant will literally go into withdrawal.An organic soil contains organic ingredients, such as alfalfa meal, which contains natural growth hormones, worm compost and mycorrhizae, as well as oodles of beneficial bacteria. No worries about the latter—as these microscopic organisms can’t be seen by the naked eye—but their effects can be. Your plants will thrive when the soil is full of them!When you use an organic potting soil and organic fertilizers, you create a self-sustaining environment in your houseplant soil. That means that the soil will do the hard work for you. If you forget to feed your houseplants, the soil continues to feed them. Some ingredients of organic potting soil, like mycorrhizae, even make your houseplants more drought resistant.Mycorrhizae is a marvelous ingredient in potting soil. You'll find it in potting soils such as the Promix line. This is a microscopic fungus that you can’t see, but it does wonders for your plants. These fungi are found outdoors in nature. As a matter of fact, they’ve been around in soil since the beginning of time.Mycorrhizal fungi are the reasons that plants thrive in nature. They attach themselves to plant roots. The plants allow the symbiotic relationship, because the mycorrhizae go out and find more nutrients and more water than the plants would on their own. And these little fungi make roots grow much larger and longer than they would without them.</p>
